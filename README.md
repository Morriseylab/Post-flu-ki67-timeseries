# Time series scRNA-seq data of Ki67 lineage traced lung cells after influenza infection
Functional regeneration of the lungâ€™s gas exchange surface following injury requires the coordination of a complex series of cell behaviors within the alveolar niche. Using a multi-modal approach, we have mapped the temporal sequencing of mouse lung regeneration after acute viral injury, demonstrating that this response is asynchronously phased across different cellular compartments. This longitudinal atlas of regeneration has produced a catalogue of new cell states that reflect transient and persistent transcriptional alterations in daughter cells as they transit across axes of differentiation. These new cell states include an injury-induced capillary endothelial cell (iCAP) that arises after injury, persists indefinitely, and shares transcriptional hallmarks with both developing lung endothelium and the endothelial aberrations found in degenerative human lung diseases. This comprehensive atlas of lung regeneration provides a foundational resource to understand the complexity of the cellular and molecular responses to injury, reveals the critical importance of capillary endothelium in maintaining and rebuilding the alveolar niche after injury, and correlates these responses to those found in development and human lung diseases.

The dataset can be found in NCBI GEO using the accession id GSE262927
